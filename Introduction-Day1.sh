# AWS CI/CD Project Documentation
# ---------------------------------------
# Services Utilized:
# - AWS Elastic Beanstalk
# - AWS RDS
# - Bitbucket Repository
# - AWS CodeBuild
# - AWS CodePipeline
#
# Purpose:
# To set up a robust CI/CD pipeline for deploying the Vprofile application 
# using AWS services, with source code migrated to Bitbucket.

# ------------------ Services ------------------

# 1. Elastic Beanstalk:
# ------------------------------------------------
# Purpose: 
# Elastic Beanstalk is used to host and deploy the Vprofile application. 
# It simplifies the deployment process by handling infrastructure scaling, 
# load balancing, and application monitoring.
# 
# Action:
# - Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment for the application.

echo "Step 1: Elastic Beanstalk Environment - Set up and configured."

# 2. AWS RDS:
# ------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
# AWS RDS (Relational Database Service) provides a managed database instance 
# that connects to our Vprofile application.
# 
# Action:
# - Provision an RDS MySQL instance for database connectivity.

echo "Step 2: AWS RDS - Provision database instance for the application."

# 3. Bitbucket Repository:
# ------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
# Store and manage the source code of the Vprofile application securely.
# 
# Action:
# - Migrate the existing repository from GitHub to Bitbucket.

echo "Step 3: Bitbucket Repository - Source code migration initiated."

# 4. Migrate Code from GitHub to Bitbucket:
# ------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
# Transfer source code to Bitbucket for better collaboration and integration 
# with AWS CI/CD services.
#
# Action:
# - Clone code from GitHub.
# - Update the remote repository to Bitbucket.
# - Push the code to the new repository.

echo "Step 4: Code Migration - GitHub to Bitbucket migration completed."

# 5. AWS CodeBuild:
# ------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
# AWS CodeBuild is responsible for fetching the source code from Bitbucket, 
# compiling, and deploying it to Elastic Beanstalk.
# 
# Action:
# - Set up a build project to integrate Bitbucket with Beanstalk deployment.

echo "Step 5: AWS CodeBuild - Configured to fetch and deploy code."

# 6. AWS CodePipeline:
# ------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
# AWS CodePipeline automates the entire CI/CD workflow by connecting 
# all services together: source, build, and deployment.
#
# Action:
# - Integrate Bitbucket, CodeBuild, and Beanstalk into a seamless pipeline.

echo "Step 6: AWS CodePipeline - Services integrated to form the CI/CD pipeline."

# 7. Testing the CI/CD Flow:
# ------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
# Verify the end-to-end CI/CD setup by pushing code changes to Bitbucket.
#
# Action:
# - Use Git commands to trigger the pipeline and validate deployment.

echo "Step 7: Testing CI/CD Flow - Push code changes using Git commands:"
echo "  git add ."
echo "  git commit -m 'Test CI/CD Flow'"
echo "  git push"
echo "Pipeline will fetch, build, and deploy the application."

# ------------------ Summary ------------------
echo "AWS CI/CD Project Documentation Complete."
echo "Services Used: Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, Bitbucket, CodeBuild, CodePipeline."
echo "End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline is ready for deployment testing."
